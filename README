6.831 UID - RS1 - AAMU: Adaptive Activation Area Menus 

== Collaborators ==

I had no collaborators. None. :-(

== Source code ==

The application was built as a jQuery plugin with modes for enabling AAMU and configuring menu time delays.

All of the source code is contained within the /public directory. Alternatively, you can see the source on github: https://github.com/salmanahmad/AAMU.

== Video URL ==

Here ya' go:

== Requirements ==

This application is browser based. It has been tested in Chrome 17 and Safari 5.2 Beta on Mac OS X Lion. That being said, it should work on Windows and Firefox as well.

== Instructions ==

This project is currently hosted on heroku. 

For a demo page: http://aamu.herokuapp.com/app.html

For the actual experiment page: http://aamu.herokuapp.com/experiment.html

Alternatively, you can run either page by double clicking on /public/app.html or /public/experiment.html and opening them in your browser. 

You can see the the logged data by opening your browser's development console and inspecting the "records" variable. I have temporarily disabled server side logging because I didn't want the TAs to have to get Postgres up and running to play with the application.
